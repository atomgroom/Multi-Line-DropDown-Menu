# Scalable and Modular HTML & LESS Multi-Line Drop Down Menu

Change Log:

01.29.14

* Initial Commit.  I created this as part of a larger project and that it might be useful to developers in the open source community.  This repository contains a HTML Dropdown menu, that is meant to mimic a HTML Select, without all the hasles of styling an HTML Select.  This drop down menu supports options that contain multiple lines of text.

* The CSS and Markup are both built with a OOCSS philosophy.  It's built to be scalable and fully modular.  You can drop the markup directly into a containing grid DIV and it will scale accordingly.  Style it to your liking!  

* This file uses a grid system I built from the 960gs, you can drop it into your grid an apply classes accordingly to get it to scale correctly in your framework.
